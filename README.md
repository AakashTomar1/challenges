** HOW TO PUSH THE LOCAL CHANGES UPSTREAM (in our case the Master branch) ** \ (•◡•) /

after making changes locally (say you solved the challenge, YAY!)in case you want to push the changes to the master repository, type in:

git status (this should tell you that you're on the branch master, if it doesn't, don't panic, share a screenshot of what it says in the grup and someone will help you)

git add .
git commit -m"specify in a few words what is your commit about here"
git push origin master 

Aaaand you're all set! You're killin it!!! ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿'̿'\̵͇̿̿\з= ( ▀ ͜͞ʖ▀) =ε/̵͇̿̿/’̿’̿ ̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿


** AFTER YOU"VE PUSHED THE CHANGES UPSTREAM ** 
What now? (¬‿¬)

You might run into conflicts, that's fine, just create a pull request and one of us will fix that and merge your changes, you'll find a CREATE PULL REQUEST button on github right next to the repository.

Well time to take on a new challenge! Show us what you got (☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞
